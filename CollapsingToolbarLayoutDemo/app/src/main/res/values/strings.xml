    <string name="details">Android Studio asks you some basic information about your application, the name, where you want to store the project files, and the package name. While the first two are self-explanatory, the package name might confuse you.The package name defines your application\'s identity and serves as a unique identifier in a variety of situations, such as on Google Play. For this reason, it must be unique. Each app has a unique package name.Because the number of Android apps is growing every day, it is common practice to use reverse domain name notation for the package name of an app. For example, the package name of an application published by Envato Tuts+ could start with com.tutsplus. Keep in mind that there is no connection between the package name and the owner of the actual domain name.In Android Studio, enter Hello World as the app name, code.tutsplus.com as Company Domain, and choose a location to store the project on your machine. The app name and company name are used to generate the package name, com.tutsplus.code.helloworld. Click Next to continue.On the following screen, you are asked to set the minimum Android SDK version you plan to support.</string>
